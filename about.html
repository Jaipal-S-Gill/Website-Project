      Automobili Lamborghini was officially established in 1963 in Sant'Agata
      Bolognese, Italy, and the same year debuted its first car, the Lamborghini
      350 GTV, a two-seater coupe with a V12 engine. The company's logo featured
      a bull, a reference to Ferruccio Lamborghini's zodiac sign, Taurus the
      bull.

      August Horch founded his first automobile company, August Horch & Cie, in
      Cologne in 1899. Shortly after that, in 1909, he set up a new automobile
      company in Zwickau, which has been operating under the name Audiwerke AG,
      Zwickau since 1910. This marked the birth of the modern company's name.

      Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898â€“1988), the company adopted its
      current name in 1945 and began producing its line of cars in 1947. Ferrari
      became a public company in 1960, and from 1969 to 2014 it was a subsidiary
      of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler
      Automobiles, in 2016.
